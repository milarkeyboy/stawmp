# Stawmp

DIY audio loop switcher aimed at pedalboards.

## Mission Statement

This aims to merge my two loves: guitar and coding. This project is mostly a
way to turn a project into a learning exercise for new langauges and tools.

<!-- TODO: fill this in a bit more -->

## Documentation

All kept in Markdown under the [docs](./docs/README.md) folder.
